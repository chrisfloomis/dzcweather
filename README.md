## Synopsis

DZCWeather is a game aid to an ongoing campaign for a table top game Dropzone Commander, which I took part in locally.  This displayed the map I created for the theatre, which has regions, cities, roads, spheres of faction influence, and a grid to assist in communication.  On the bottom you can select a region which will make an API call to get the weather in the region.  All regions were mapped to real world locations to get a realistic weather forecast.

## Motivation

I wanted a more realistic and compelling game experience.  I've been a part of story driven campaigns in the past, but they captured the feeling of being in command of the forces in a theatre as they lacked a real tie in to a map (if they had one), and I had never seen weather attempted in a realistic fashion (more than a one off game where players agree it is raining, for example).  I really wanted to set the mood and claim some braggin rights.
